","[Attribute 1: TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The California PUC's rejection of Governor Davis' proposed rate agreement with DWR.

[Attribute 2: MAIN DETAILS ABOUT TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The PUC voted 4-1 against the proposal, which aimed to eliminate PUC oversight of DWR contracts and mandate that all DWR power contract costs be passed to utility rates. The rejection raises concerns about how California will finance DWR power contracts and the $12.5 billion in bonds needed for budgetary support.

[Attribute 3: IMPORTANT FACTS/EVENTS]: The vote has embarrassed Governor Davis and undermined his strategy for addressing California's electricity crisis. A bipartisan bill (18XX) proposing a dedicated rate component to service the bonds has gained support, but Davis is inclined to veto it based on advice from the Treasurer. The likelihood of an Edison bailout appears low as the Legislature prepares for a special session.","[Attribute 1: TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The rejection of a proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC by the PUC and its implications for California's energy crisis.

[Attribute 2: MAIN DETAILS ABOUT TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The vote was 4-1, with two Republican members siding with Davis's appointees. The proposal aimed to streamline the approval process for DWR's contracts and ensure that utilities would pass through DWR's hydro contract expenses to consumers. The rejection of the proposal raises concerns about how California will finance its power contracts and intensifies legislative pressure to renegotiate or break these contracts.

[Attribute 3: IMPORTANT FACTS/EVENTS]: The PUC's decision leaves uncertainty regarding the funding for $12.5 billion in bonds related to DWR's power contracts. A bipartisan bill is being considered to create a special rate component on customer bills to service these bonds, but it does not address how DWR's contracting costs will be covered.

","[Attribute 1: TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: Governor Gray Davis is developing a new plan to expedite the borrowing of $12.5 billion to address California's budget shortfall from the energy crisis.

[Attribute 2: MAIN DETAILS ABOUT TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The plan may be issued as an executive order and aims to bypass the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) oversight, which previously rejected Davis's proposal. The new approach would allow the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to manage the allocation of funds from utility bills to ensure bond repayment without directly setting rates.

[Attribute 3: IMPORTANT FACTS/EVENTS]: The PUC's rejection of the original plan was based on concerns about its adequacy and the authority it granted to the DWR. Davis opposes a competing legislative bill that prioritizes bond buyers over energy suppliers, fearing it could lead to legal disputes. The governor must act on the bill by Sunday, and if the new plan is approved, bonds could be marketed early next year to address a projected $4 billion to $6 billion shortfall.","[Attribute 1: TOPIC/CENTRAL IDEA]: The governor is developing a new plan to expedite the borrowing of $12.5 billion to address the state's budget shortfall from the energy crisis.
